# stunpack

**Stunts/4D [Sports] Driving game resource unpacker**

This program decodes packed resources and graphics routine code files used by the PC version of the game "Stunts" (Br√∏derbund), also published as "4D Sports Driving" (Mindscape) and "4D Driving" (Electronic Arts).

An encoder has not been made as the game accepts uncompressed resource files.

Stunts 1.0 files are not supported.

## Building

Run "make".

## Usage

The program requires at least one parameter as the source file path. If the optional destination file path is omitted a new filename is generated by adding the ".out" extension to the source file name. Except for the DOS version, where the last character of the source file name is replaced by a "_" in the destination file name.

For a full list of options run "stunpack -h".

## Additional documentation

The data format, compression algorithms and applied optimisations are described in the [Stunts Wiki](https://wiki.stunts.hu/wiki/Compression).
