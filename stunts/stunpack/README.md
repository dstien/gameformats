stunpack - Stunts/4D [Sports] Driving game resource unpacker

ABOUT

 This program decodes packed resources and graphics routine code files used
 by the PC version of the game "Stunts" (Broderbund), also published as
 "4D Sports Driving" (Mindscape) and "4D Driving" (Electronic Arts).

 An encoder has not been made as the game accepts uncompressed resource files.

 Stunts 1.0 files are not supported.

BUILDING

 Run "make".

USAGE

 The program requires at least one parameter as the source file path. If the
 optional destination file path is omitted a new filename is generated by
 adding the ".out" extension to the source file name. Except for the DOS
 version, where the last character of the source file name is replaced by
 a "_" in the destination file name.

 For a full list of options run "stunpack -h".
